# Profile

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Hangzhou Dianzi University, advised by Prof. Chongyang Deng. I received my B.S. degree from Southwest University of Science and Technology in 2020. My research interests focus on computer aided geometric design (CAGD), particularly the construction and applications of genuine multi-sided parametric surface patches and polyhedral volumes.

[ C^0 Generalized Coons Patches for High-order Cage-based Deformation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3687972)   
[**Quickly Preview**](https://github.com/kaikai-qin/kaikai-qin.github.io/blob/main/images/low-res-c0-deformation.pdf) & [**Full Paper**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kQjEEVuF3e0rQNQUkLlrPrc3kHB1Iw79/view?usp=sharing)  
**Kaikai Qin**, Yunhao Zhou, Chenhao Ying, Yajuan Li, and Chongyang Deng
- It generalizes rectangular and triangular Coons patches, works in any dimension, supports arbitrary polytopes, even non-manifold topologies, and has an elegant mathematical form. We applied this method to high-order cage-based deformation, which offers more degrees of freedom and achieves smoother results compared to traditional linear cage-based deformation.
